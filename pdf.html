        <h3 id="about">About me</h3>
        <p> I am a cross-paradigm, performance driven, Scala/Java Software Developer who specializes in meta-programming. With a passion for learning new languages and paradigms I can adapt to any team. I'm becoming increasingly aware of I am currently working on a language backend for Process Systems Enterprise, London, remotely from Palmerston North, New Zealand, as well as working in the scalameta ecosystem in my own time for open source.

        <h3 id="opensource">Open Source</h3>
        <div class="opensource">
    <p>I have a passion for writing code, especially when it is consumed by a large number of users. I'm always looking for more ways to help out the open source community, either on Gitter or via PR's. Ideally I would like to work completely open source and believe that all companies should open source all their libraries where it is appropriate.

    <p><b>Company: </b>Electric Memory IT (EMIT)<br>
        <b>Contracted To: </b>Process Systems Enterprise (PSE)<br>
        <b>Time Employed: </b>June 2015 - Present</p>

    <p>Based in Palmerston North, New Zealand, Contracting out to Process Systems Enterprise, which is based in London.

        <br>
        <br>
        I am working on the gPROMS family of integrated modelling environments (IME's), designed for various engineers who design incredibly complex systems. The kernel is written in C++ and Fortran, with the UI written in Java. gPROMS is primarily a procedural/declarative language that is used to run simulations/optimizations etc. Thus the IME's act much like an IDE would for a Software Developer. With large global clients such as Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals and Shell Petroleum I take the quality of code I produce very seriously.

        <div class="standard_flex_item">
            <h5>New Language Engine (NLE)</h5>
            <p>The purpose of this project was primarily to remove a large chunk of the remaining CORBA code in our codebase. Using Antlr4 as our parser and lexer, with Scala as the language of choice, we managed to build an fast, immutable, threadsafe and storage efficient language module.
</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="standard_flex_item">
            <h5>Moving from Maven to Gradle</h5>
            <p>Our build system is rather complex, we have multiple "code generation" steps, multiple JVM languages being used, extra post-compile tasks (obfuscation and encryption) and multiple repositories. The build was designed to be modular via Gradle plugins.
</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="standard_flex_item">
            <h5>Flowsheet Routing</h5>
            <p>Our users were generating models in other applications, with 2000+ models and connections between them. The routing took place on Swings GUI Thread (EDT) and thus blocked the user from working while it happened. For user-generated projects this could happen on project load and trigger up to 8 hour GUI freezes. Of course, this is not acceptable, thus I moved all routing off the EDT. The largest problem was undo. We had asynchronous edits that had to be managed within Swings very synchronous and sequential undo system.

            <dt>Scala</dt>
            <dd>I have been writing Scala code since 2012, working with it in industry for the past 2 years. I consider myself an advanced Scala user and have given talks on Scala before. Most of my open source work has been creating and/or contributing to Scala libraries. I've a large number of Scala libraries, but most commonly Cats, Monix, Circe and Scalameta.

            <dt>Java</dt>
            <dd>Java was the first language I learnt. Self taught while I was at high school I have been writing Java code since 2011. A large portion of the codebase I work in is Java and I consider myself an advanced Java user.

            <dt>Python</dt>

        <div class="standard_flex_item">
            <dt>Javascript</dt>
            <dd>I've written a lot of javascript, mostly during my time at university, I have experience ES5, ES6, Typescript and Coffeescript. I've also written code in AngularJS, Angular and React, using tools such as NPM, Bower, Gulp and Webkit.

            <dd>A large portion of my work recently has been writing ANTLR4 Grammars, a Scala AST to go with them and ensuring performance has been optimal. Due to this, I've subclassed and replaced large portions of the ANTLR code as it was non-optimal, generating far too much garbage for our uses.

            <dd>Last year I taught myself basic category theory. I wanted to get a ground up understanding of category theory so that when working with the Cats library, I could understand the reasoning and terminology. In particular, I wanted to develop an understanding the Free Monads and Natural Transformations. I still want to do far more research into this field and personally believe it should be part of every Computer Science curriculum globally.

            <dt>Functional Programming</dt>
            <dd>I believe that Functional Programming is a far too common of a phrase these days, when a lot of people mean "programming with functions". Functional programming is not just about having functions representable at the type level. I use purely immutable data structures and try to be as pure as possible, handling effects at the type level, where it does not affect Readability, Maintainability or Performance. I can proudly say that I have not deliberately used the keyword "null" in my code, for well over a year.
